## Project analysis

### User profile

- create a user persona for your website.

**Juan José Gómez**, 24 years old, is a computer science engineering student, and she enjoys modern design and seeks user-friendly interfaces and understand.

### Information architecture

- describe using around 200 words (minimum) how you have distributed the page's information.

**The page the page is made in html and css**, and the distribution of information in the page is different depending on two cases. If it is **on a personal computer**, in the top appears a header and navbar, and in the footer appears in the bottom, and in the middle the central content is divided into two columns: The first column it is for the aside which contains a personal image (logo the UdG), personal information (name and surname, place and year of birth, residence and postal code, contact information, etc ...) and a list of speak languages; And the second column it is for a central content of the page, which contains a information about studies, work experience, hobbies, skills and portfolio (personal projects). The content appears, the studies and work experience in list, the hobbies and skills in group of badges, and the portfolio in a group of cards with title, content and link to GitHub repositories. Else if it is **on a mobile phone**, all page content appears in block, that is, in the top appears a header and navbar, followed by aside and central content of the page, and in the bottom appears the footer. The footer contains my name and the year of development, and the navbar contains a list items align to center. And in the header add a select, that allows you to select the language with appears the texts in the page this will be done with javascript. **To do website more accessible, for all image contains a alternative text**, *there is only one image*.

### Visual design

- describe using around 200 words (minimum) the main decisions you have made for the visual design.

**The main decisions** I have made for the visual design affect the typography and the background and text colors of the page. **The typography** that use in the page, is a Arial as principal typography and a Helvetica and Sans-Serif as secondary typography, in this way, if the Arial font was not avaiable, then the page would be displayed in Helvetica or Sans-Serif. I have chosen these sources (Arial, Helvetica and Sans-Serif) because they will always be avaiable, and they are more like Roboto, and also, the sources Arial and Sans-Serif communicate a modern/clean, and rounded shapes communicate a friendly/informal, that is, young.

As for our **main color palette**. **The primary color** is a #00206F (dark blue or midnightblue), and **the secondary color** is a #0132AE (lighter blue or navy). The primary color will be color of a buttons, the header, the navbar, and the footer, and the secondary color will be color of backgroud the aside. And the text color will be a black in light backgroud, and a white in dark backgroud. This contrast between the background color and the text color is a very good. *[Test 1](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-00206f) and [Test 2](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-0132ae)*. Good contrast makes it easier for the user to see and read.

Another theme available is a **dark theme** which a **primary color** is #0A0A0A and a **secondary color** is #111111 (*[Test 1](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-0a0a0a) and [Test 2](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-111111)*), and a **blood theme** which a **primary color** is #5D0000 and a **secondary color** is #841414 (*[Test 1](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-5d0000) and [Test 2](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-841414)*).

The **Dark theme** has better color contrast and improves accessibility for people with low vision. And the **blood theme** is only communicate a blood color/vampire style.

### Extra functions

Other functions implemented in header is a two input select and one button.

- **Language selector**. Is a input select which selected a one language, and that show content of website in selected language.

- **Theme selector**. Is a input select which selected a one theme between all availables (Light by default, Dark, and Blood).

- **Disco mode activation button**. Is a simple button, with play icon, which triggers a css animation that rotate the image, the links and icons of the website, and triggers a other css animation that change background color the body every one second, *this in a similar to a disco or demonic possession*. **Warning! This CSS animation is not accessible**.
